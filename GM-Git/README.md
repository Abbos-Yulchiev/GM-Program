# GM-Git

Of all the conversations I find myself having over and over in this field, I think more than anything else I’ve been a
broken record convincing teams **not** to adopt GitFlow.

Vincent Driessen’s post “A successful Git branching model” – or, as it’s become commonly known for some reason,
“GitFlow” – has become the de facto standard for how to successfully adopt git into your team. If you search for “git
branching strategy” on Google, it’s the number one result. Atlassian has even adopted it as one of their primary
tutorials for adopting Git.
